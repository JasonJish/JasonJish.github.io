  <br><br>Abstract
  <br>(1) Research Highlights: Existing studies primarily focus on the supply-side evaluation of urban forest accessibility, emphasizing physical proximity while often overlooking real-time usage patterns and demographic-specific exposure. This study shifts the focus to social exposure, analyzing how diverse population groups interact with urban forests across different times of the day, integrating dynamic accessibility metrics. (2) Background and Objectives: Unlike previous research that predominantly assessed urban forest accessibility through conventional models based on static spatial proximity, this study incorporates spatiotemporal population distribution data to capture actual utilization patterns. By introducing a dynamic, exposure-based framework, this research aims to facilitate equitable and temporally sensitive access to green spaces across diverse demographic groups. (3) Materials and Methods: This study focuses on Seoul, South Korea, and applies the Gaussian-based Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (G2SFCA) methodology to assess urban forest accessibility. Living population data (2021–2024) from mobile telecommunications sources were used as demand indicators, while OpenStreetMap (OSM) green space data were utilized as supply indicators. Realistic travel distances were calculated using OSM pedestrian networks and Dijkstra’s algorithm, incorporating slope effects and distance decay functions. A K-means clustering algorithm was applied to classify four distinct exposure types based on demographic and temporal variations. (4) Results: The findings reveal significant disparities in urban forest exposure based on age group and time of day. Four major urban forest exposure patterns were identified: Type A—school-age children, with peak usage around midday; Type B—working-age adults, frequenting mid-sized urban forests during commuting and leisure hours; Type C—elderly individuals, utilizing large-scale urban forests and neighborhood parks mainly in the morning; Type D—young adults, engaging with small urban parks and rest areas at various times. (5) Conclusions: Urban forest management must move beyond the quantitative expansion of green spaces and instead implement customized policies that optimize accessibility and equitable distribution based on distinct temporal and demographic patterns of social exposure. By integrating real-time urban mobility data into urban forest planning, policies can better align green space supply with actual usage, fostering a more equitable, data-driven, and sustainable urban green infrastructure.

  <br><br>Abstract
  <br>This study introduces a trail-based framework for assessing spatially explicit cultural ecosystem services (ES) at a microscale, focusing on individual trail experiences within a mountain range. By integrating agent-based modeling with hiking data, we simulate and quantify the consumption of cultural ES by individuals on various trails, considering factors such as seasonal variations. Our approach contrasts with traditional map-based methods by emphasizing the dynamic, activity-based assessment of cultural ES supply and demand. The findings reveal significant spatial mismatches between the potential cultural ES provided by trails and their potential consumption by hiking, highlighting the importance of localized, trail-specific evaluations. The study's implications extend to environmental policy and management, where understanding these mismatches can guide targeted conservation and development efforts. While this study presents a contribution, we acknowledge limitations related to the geographic focus and dataset scope, suggesting that future research should incorporate more diverse data sources and expand the geographic range. This could enable more accurate simulations and assessments, particularly in data-scarce regions. Ultimately, this trail-based approach enhances the precision of cultural ES evaluation and offers valuable tools for policymakers and environmental managers to align conservation efforts with actual human activities.

  <br><br>Abstract
  <br>This study develops and applies an open-source analytical tool to examine accessibility disparities in Seoul’s public bike-sharing service. To capture realistic travel conditions, the tool incorporates slope-induced variations in cycling speed, waiting times at traffic signals, and other transportation factors in its calculation of service areas and accessibility indices. The methodology is based on the Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA) framework, integrating both supply and demand while considering distance decay effects.

The analytical tool, Sel_PedLink, was designed following the principles of open geospatial science to ensure reproducibility and replicability. It calculates detailed access and egress times between bike rental stations and surrounding buildings, and derives quantitative accessibility indicators at the building level. Dijkstra’s algorithm was employed for shortest path analysis, while slope conditions and crosswalk delays were incorporated as adjustable variables. The tool’s performance was evaluated using the root mean square deviation (RMSD), followed by comparative analyses with existing commercial route-finding services to demonstrate its necessity and advantages. Empirical validation was conducted through real cycling data, confirming the accuracy of travel time estimations and the appropriateness of slope-based speed adjustments.

As a case study, the tool was applied to measure accessibility gaps across Seoul’s bike-sharing system, analyzing buildings classified by residential, commercial, public/educational, office, industrial, and other land uses. The findings identified vulnerable areas with limited accessibility, providing insights for policy development on equitable service provision and resource reallocation.

By being openly available, Sel_PedLink reduces reliance on costly proprietary software and enhances research transparency. Although this study focuses on slope and signal delay as variables, the open-source framework allows future researchers to adapt and extend the tool with additional attributes as needed. Ultimately, this research contributes both a methodological advancement and a practical foundation for promoting sustainable, accessible, and equitable urban mobility.

  <br><br>Abstract
  <br>Crowd crush accidents, one of the catastrophic urban disasters, have become frequent due to urban growth. To alleviate those potential risks, it is critical to not only understand the characteristics of pedestrian flow, but also provide appropriate crowd management, simultaneously. In this sense, our study examines how the population density increases according to the multiple variables associated with pedestrian movements (e.g., population, path width) and crowd control methods (e.g., right- hand traffic) through agent based modeling (ABM). In detail, we first built a passage in a virtual space and measured the population density changes over time with respect to the various pedestrian attributes (e.g., incoming counts and group ratio) and the passage characteristics (e.g., width and length). We then revisited the Itaewon stampede, which occurred in October 2022, and simulated how the population density would be curbed if a side barrier had been removed or the pedestrian rule had been implemented. As results, the pedestrian counts in the passage and the width of the passage were the two most significant variables causing the crowdedness. In addition, two advancements (i.e., right-hand traffic and no barrier in the passage) to the Itaewon stampede would result in meaningful improvement in the population density (i.e., less than six people /m2), which is less than the risky crowd crush threshold. Our study suggests that the population density monitoring system and pedestrian policy should be implemented in the future to effectively prevent the crowd crush accidents.

  <br><br>Abstract
  <br>Immersive technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) not only stimulate travelers' needs before, during, and after a trip but also provide new experiences. As the COVID-19 outbreak continues and non-face-to-face activities are preferred, the tourism industry considers immersive technology as an alternative tool to fulfill a traveler’s needs when traveling. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the value of virtual reality as a means to experience traveling and to understand the perception and behavior of tourists in virtual spaces and at tourist destinations from a behavioral geographic perspective. To do so, this research selected K Campus, located in Seoul, Republic of Korea, as the research destination and established virtual reality content for the experiment. This study used qualitative data from interviews and mental maps to better understand tourist perceptions and behavior. The data collected through interviews and mental maps is collected at two different periods: after the VR experience (t1) and after visiting the destination (t2). The results of the interview categorized the VR experience as (1) arousal, (2) immersive experience, (3) sensory experience, and (4) spatial presence. Furthermore, after visiting the destination, participants stated that movement in the virtual space influenced their actual behavior. This study attempted an in-depth approach to investigate participants' psychological states and perceptions.

  <br><br>Abstract
  <br>The floating car data (FCD) method uses real-time vehicle locations to estimate traffic conditions. The use of FCD products for research can be limited by their costs and accessibility mainly because such datasets are collected by private companies. In this study, we propose a research method that utilizes FCD-based real-time traffic data from Google Maps. We constructed a real-time traffic map-based database (RTMDB) by compiling time-series real-time traffic map images. Using the RTMDB, we analyzed spatiotemporal congestion patterns in Montgomery County, Maryland, U.S.A. To check the reliability of RTMDB, a comparison analysis was conducted with traffic sensor data collected in the field. Results show that RTMDB is closely correlated to the collected data from traffic speed monitoring sensors. We also analyzed the congestion patterns depending on road types and AM/PM rush-hours.

  <br><br>Abstract
  <br>With the gradual expansion of the scope of research in geography and the vast amount of research results being produced, it has become difficult to grasp the trend of research in recent geography studies. In this study, we tried to analyze the recent research trend and topics of geography by analyzing the abstracts submitted to the AAG Conference from 2018 to 2020, using the LDA-based Topic Modeling. All words in the abstract were tokenized and lemmatized to extract only nouns and adjectives. Eight topics; 'Political Ecology,' 'Geospatial Science,' 'Urban Development,' 'Geospatial Visualization,' 'Land Cover Change,' 'Health Geography,' 'Urban Community' and 'Political Geography' has been generated through the LDA. This study could contribute to geography researchers understanding the overall research trends in geography and exploring research topics that have recently drawn attention.
