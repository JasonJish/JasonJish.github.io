  <br><br>Abstract
  <br>Crowd crush accidents, one of the catastrophic urban disasters, have become frequent due to urban growth. To alleviate those potential risks, it is critical to not only understand the characteristics of pedestrian flow, but also provide appropriate crowd management, simultaneously. In this sense, our study examines how the population density increases according to the multiple variables associated with pedestrian movements (e.g., population, path width) and crowd control methods (e.g., right- hand traffic) through agent based modeling (ABM). In detail, we first built a passage in a virtual space and measured the population density changes over time with respect to the various pedestrian attributes (e.g., incoming counts and group ratio) and the passage characteristics (e.g., width and length). We then revisited the Itaewon stampede, which occurred in October 2022, and simulated how the population density would be curbed if a side barrier had been removed or the pedestrian rule had been implemented. As results, the pedestrian counts in the passage and the width of the passage were the two most significant variables causing the crowdedness. In addition, two advancements (i.e., right-hand traffic and no barrier in the passage) to the Itaewon stampede would result in meaningful improvement in the population density (i.e., less than six people /m2), which is less than the risky crowd crush threshold. Our study suggests that the population density monitoring system and pedestrian policy should be implemented in the future to effectively prevent the crowd crush accidents.

  abstract={With the gradual expansion of the scope of research in geography and the vast amount of research results being produced, it has become difficult to grasp the trend of research in recent geography studies. In this study, we tried to analyze the recent research trend and topics of geography by analyzing the abstracts submitted to the AAG Conference from 2018 to 2020, using the LDA-based Topic Modeling. All words in the abstract were tokenized and lemmatized to extract only nouns and adjectives. Eight topics; 'Political Ecology,' 'Geospatial Science,' 'Urban Development,' 'Geospatial Visualization,' 'Land Cover Change,' 'Health Geography,' 'Urban Community' and 'Political Geography' has been generated through the LDA. This study could contribute to geography researchers understanding the overall research trends in geography and exploring research topics that have recently drawn attention.

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
